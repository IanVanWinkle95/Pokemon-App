Tried to use the last lab as a good framework to start this project. Got very confused when I was trying to run the program from my html and not http://localhost:3000/....
Made a bunch of different folders and files to start the projext and just made it more confusing then it needed to be. Got caught up trying to remeber where I put what.
Luis helped more a bunch with the actual fetching of the data. Ran into a lot of errors but he helped me better understand how to go about fixing errors for this project.
Wanted to add more to the appilication like adding the data to the page but spent countless hours going in circles. Could see myself coming back to this project in the 
future to add those features.
